          <p>   Brian is currently a full-stack development student who will be receiving his certification from The
            University of Pennyslvania in May 2020. During this coding bootcamp, Brian will have gained working
            knowledge of various languages, frameworks and development tools, such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js,
            ReactJS, MongoDB, MySQL, and more.</p>
          <br />
          <p>   His first exposure to world of coding was as a technical recruiter, where he placed dozens of
            high-level engineers and architects into full-time roles. He has since developed a strong passion for
            building steamlined applications to help businesses and people optimize their time. Once Brian has had an
            opportunity to get his feet wet in the industry, he plans to pursue further education related to cloud
            infrastructure, and he is also very interested in opportunities around smart-contracts.
